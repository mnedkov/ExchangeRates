Installation instructions

Exchange rates is a JEE application contained in a war file. It runs on a web server which needs to be compatible with the Servlet 3.1 spec. It does not need a full blown application server that covers the full JEE spec, just a servlet container is enough. It has been tested with Tomcat 8 but it should work on any container that supports Servlet 3.1 or higher e.g. Jetty, JBoss, Glassfish etc.

To install the application in your container it is always best to refer the installation procedure for new application pertaining to your container.

If you use Tomcat 8 then usually(dependending on your server configuration) it is enough to just drop the war file into the web apps directory. Alternatively, one can use the manager application which is a web UI for administering the server(including deplyment of new applications). More info can be found here: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Deploy_A_New_Application_Archive_%28WAR%29_Remotely

The installation procedure for other containers is somehow similar - drop the war file into the designated folder or use the web UI.

For dev purposes, run using webapp runner: 
java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --port 8081 target/*.war
