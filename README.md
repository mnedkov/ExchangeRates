# spring-rest-angular-bootstrap-example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mnedkov/spring-rest-angular-bootstrap-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mnedkov/spring-rest-angular-bootstrap-example)

I implemented this application over a weekend when applying for a job. It took me two 12 hour sessions and I passed the interview.

The angular version in use(1.5) is legacy by now but still some parts of the application can be used as a reference when starting a new project.
